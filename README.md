# Exercise 1: Create and View a Satellite Scenario
This example demonstrates how to set up a satellite scenario and view it.  

# Exercise 2: Perform Satellite Access Analysis
This example demonstrates how to set up a visibility access analysis between one satellite and one ground station.  The example calculates the times over the course of a day when the satellite can see the ground station.

# Exercise 3: Dynamic Link Analysis
This example demonstrates how to set up a satellite communications downlink between one satellite and one ground station.  The example calculates the times over the course of a day during when the satellite can communicate with the ground station.
